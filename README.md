# Tic-Tac-Toe
Beginner Level Code Project

this is to start to develop my coding skills. 
the plan is to create 5 projects of 3 difficulty ranges 
from beginner, intermediate, to advanced.

along side this leaning I will also be going/using code wars 
to practice and sharpen my skills in programming and problem solving.


After finishing the project
